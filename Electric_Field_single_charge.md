# Classical Electrodynamics Exxample - Electric Field 

## 1. Introduction

The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, representing the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge placed at a point in space. Unlike Newtonian mechanics, which describes forces between objects directly, the concept of the electric field introduces a field-theoretic approach to explain electromagnetic interactions. This field is a vector field that permeates space and is generated by charges and time-varying magnetic fields, according to Maxwell’s equations.

An understanding of the electric field at the graduate level goes beyond Coulomb’s law, extending into how electric fields interact with other fields, how they are derived from potential functions, and their relationship to the sources of the fields, such as charge densities and currents.

## 2. Electric Field from Coulomb’s Law

For static (electrostatic) cases, the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) due to a point charge \( q \) at a position \( \mathbf{r}_0 \) is given by Coulomb's law in its vector form:

$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0|^3}
$$
