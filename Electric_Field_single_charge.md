# Classical Electrodynamics Exxample - Electric Field 

## 1. Introduction

The electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, representing the force per unit charge exerted on a test charge placed at a point in space. Unlike Newtonian mechanics, which describes forces between objects directly, the concept of the electric field introduces a field-theoretic approach to explain electromagnetic interactions. This field is a vector field that permeates space and is generated by charges and time-varying magnetic fields, according to Maxwell’s equations.

An understanding of the electric field at the graduate level goes beyond Coulomb’s law, extending into how electric fields interact with other fields, how they are derived from potential functions, and their relationship to the sources of the fields, such as charge densities and currents.

## 2. Electric Field from Coulomb’s Law

For static (electrostatic) cases, the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) due to a point charge \( q \) at a position \( \mathbf{r}_0 \) is given by Coulomb's law in its vector form:

$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0|^3}
$$

Where:
- \( \mathbf{r} \) is the position vector where the electric field is being measured,
- \( \mathbf{r}_0 \) is the position vector of the point charge,
- \( q \) is the magnitude of the charge,
- \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{Nm}^2 \) is the permittivity of free space.

This expression shows that the electric field due to a point charge decreases with the square of the distance and is directed radially outward from the charge for positive \( q \) (inward for negative \( q \)).

### 2.1 Generalization for Charge Distributions

For a continuous charge distribution, we generalize Coulomb’s law by integrating over the charge density \( \rho(\mathbf{r}') \):

$$
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}') (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|^3} \, d^3r'
$$

Where \( \rho(\mathbf{r}') \) is the charge density at point \( \mathbf{r}' \). This integral expresses the superposition principle in a continuous system, showing that the total electric field is the sum (integral) of contributions from each infinitesimal charge element.

## 3. Electric Field and the Potential Function

In electrostatics, the electric field \( \mathbf{E} \) is related to the scalar electric potential \( \Phi \) by:

$$
\mathbf{E} = - \nabla \Phi
$$

The scalar potential \( \Phi(\mathbf{r}) \) is related to the charge distribution via Poisson's equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \Phi = -\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

For regions without charge (\( \rho = 0 \)), this reduces to Laplace’s equation:

$$
\nabla^2 \Phi = 0
$$

The electric potential simplifies the calculation of electric fields in many cases, especially when the system exhibits symmetry. For example, solving Laplace’s or Poisson’s equation with boundary conditions can lead to solutions for the potential, from which the electric field is directly obtained.
