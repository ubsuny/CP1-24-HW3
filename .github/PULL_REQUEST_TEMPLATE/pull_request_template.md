# Pull Request Templating for Beginners #
The most common way **YOU** will interact with, and submit material to any repository you work on is via a "Pull Request".
Now not just any old Pull Request will do however; because hard at work making sure your repository stays in tip-top shape are the wonderful maintainers and reviewers whose task it is to review pull requests and maintain the repository so that they meet up-to-date regulatory standards.
If you follow this simple guide you too can be submitting Grade A pull requests that will have reviewers saying "Gee this pull request sure is swell. **Approved!**"

To ensure that your pull request is a real winner make sure it includes the following:
  - A legible title that describes what is contained within the pull request.
  - A legible description that goes into more detail than your title regarding what each file contained within the request is and does.
  - A reference to any currently open issues that pertain to your pull request.
  - And make sure to label and add a milestone to your pull request.

If you have followed these steps you're on your way to a successful pull request.
However, today's youthful programmers also need to format the file structure of their pull requests so the repository can remain clean and organized.

The general structure of your pull request should be the following:
  - A directory folder labeled in accordance with your assigned task.
    - Within should contain:
    - Two or more separate module files containing your function algorithms titled after each, and the appropriate docstrings.
    - One or more files containing the unit tests for your algorithms and the appropriate unit test title.
    - Finally, for clarity, you can add a helpful README.md that further describes your algorithms, their tests, and how to run them.
   
With this, you now have the makings of a solid and respectable pull request.

So get out there champ and start submitting **TODAY**.

*Any distress or bodily harm that may come as a result of the reviewing process or by the maintainer is not the responsibility of said reviewers and maintainers.*

So the first task for a successful pull request is: 

**remove now this template text and write a good description of what your pull request is about in its place**
